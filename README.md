# Card Rewards
This repository corresponds to a card rewards program according to customer loyalty using Advanced Data Structures.

To carry out this implementation we use the C language and the Advanced Data Structures Heap and Union and Find, in addition to basic elements of the language such as pointers, structs and dynamic allocation.

This project was developed in collaboration with developer Wesley Farias (@wesley3979).
